Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medical products that are exempt.
Import duty is an additional sales tax applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions.
The receipt lists the name of all the items, each with its price, including tax; the total cost of the items; 
and the total amounts of tax paid. Tax is applied to each item individually—for a sales tax of n% the item should be listed 
on the receipt with a price of np/100 rounded up to the nearest 5¢ (e.g. a $1.01 item taxed at 5% has 10¢ in tax for a receipt 
price of $1.10). For a quantity greater than one compute the total cost of items and apply the rounding to the line item total.
In other words, for a quantity q, round the result of qnp/100 to the nearest 5¢. Write an application that prints out the receipt 
details for these shopping baskets...
