Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medical products that are exempt.
Import duty is an additional sales tax applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions.
The receipt lists the name of all the items, each with its price, including tax; the total cost of the items; 
and the total amounts of tax paid. Tax is applied to each item individually—for a sales tax of n% the item should be listed 
on the receipt with a price of np/100 rounded up to the nearest 5¢ (e.g. a $1.01 item taxed at 5% has 10¢ in tax for a receipt 
price of $1.10). For a quantity greater than one compute the total cost of items and apply the rounding to the line item total.
In other words, for a quantity q, round the result of qnp/100 to the nearest 5¢. Write an application that prints out the receipt 
details for these shopping baskets...

Java: Please use current java technology to solve the problem and return a production ready deployable bundle of the solution 
– this means we should be able to run the samples presented and get the output very easily. 
Please include any tests as well as a README file containing any assumptions that you’ve made along the way.

Android: Please use current technology to solve the problem and return an Android application – this means we 
should be able to run the samples presented and get the output very easily. Please use the ToolBar and at least one fragment 
in your solution. Please include any tests as well as a README file containing any assumptions that you’ve made along the way. 
Finally, please provide command line build instructions for your application. 
We will test your submission on a device/emulator with the API matching the minSdk of your submission.

Note that you can use any other front end technology like (HTML&CSS, Angular Js, React...) to capture user inputs and 
invoke the java program to calculate taxes and then display the receipt/results back to the user.
